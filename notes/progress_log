### What I did
- Set up clean R project structure and GitHub repository.
- Resolved Git/GitHub synchronization issues.
- Downloaded and renamed ESS rounds 1–8 (Stata format).
- Wrote and ran `02_import_ess.R`.
- Successfully combined ESS waves 1–8 into a single dataset
  (`ess_raw_combined.rds`).
- Verified presence of key variables:
  - party vote variables (`prtvt*`)
  - immigration-related items (`im*`)
  - political trust items (`trstprl`, `trstplt`, `trstprt`).

### What worked / issues
- ESS import and stacking worked as expected.
- Variable coverage confirmed via sanity checks.
- No data loss in vote or trust variables.

### Next steps
- Translate author-provided SPSS syntax for individual-level variables
  (political trust, immigration attitudes, authoritarianism).
- Implement this logic in `03_harmonize_ess.R`.
